January 6, 2023 - I am now beginning the admin dashboard project, the final project of the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course as a part of The Odin Project's full stack Javascript track. I will primarily be focusing on implementing what I have learned about CSS Grid to build an admin dashboard page featuring a grid-based project section, navagational sidebar, and other elements.

January 16, 2023 - I have finished the admin dashboard project. The page has almost no interactive elements, as I focused almost entirely on implementing Grid and making the page look nice. In addition, I spent a great deal of time trying to make the page responsive to different screen sizes. I have not properly learned about responsive web design yet, and it isn't perfect here, but I'm pretty happy with what I accomplished.
